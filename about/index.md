My name is Gareth and I am a first year PhD student studying [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/) at Oregon Health & Science University. I am currently a student in Dr. Bonnie Nagel's [Developmental Brain Imaging Lab](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/psychiatry/research/developmental-brain-imaging-lab/index.cfm) where I am interested in using high dimensional behavioral and neuroimaging data to build models to predict trait behavior leading to alcohol and substance abuse in adolescence.  

Prior to beginning graduate school I was a research assistant in the genetics department at the Casey Eye Institue. My work involved exploring methods to assess the quality and reliability of the photoreceptor mosaic as captured by `adaptive optics` imaging. Additionally, I worked as a developer and engineer in Dr. Bonnie Nagel's developmental neuroimaging lab where I helped to develop and maintain pipelines to process and interpret multi-modal neuroimaing data.
