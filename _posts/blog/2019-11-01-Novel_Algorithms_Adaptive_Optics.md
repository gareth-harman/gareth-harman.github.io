## Novel Algorithms for Adaptive Optics

Adaptive optics is an imaging modality designed by NASA to track russian satellites during the Cold War.

\\(C_i\\) is a matrix containing the pixel coordinates for each of the n cones from image \\(i\\).

$$
C_{i}=\left[\begin{array}{c}{\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)} \\ {\cdots} \\ {\left(x_{n}, y_{n}\right)}\end{array}\right]
$$

We can represent pixel coordinates \\((x_1, y_1)\\) for the first cone in set \\(C_i\\) as \\(c_1\\) and declare the Euclidean distance between coordinates \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\) as \\(|c_1, c_2|^2\\)


$$
\left(x_{1}-x_{2}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{1}-y_{2}\right)^{2}=\left\|c_{1}, c_{2}\right\|^{2}
$$

We then create a vector of distances between \\(c_i\\) of set \\(C_i\\) and all of the cones \\((x)\\) for each of images \\(N\\)

$$
X_{i}=\left\|c_{i}, x\right\|^{2}: x \in C_{N}
$$

\\(c_i\\) is said to be a shared cone if there exists a cone within the declared length \\(t\\), 5 pixels, of all other sets of images

$$
f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{1,} & {\text { if } \min \left(X_{i}\right) \leq t: \text { for all } \mathrm{N} \text { sessions }} \\ {0,} & {\text { else }}\end{array}\right.
$$

In the case that multiple cones from one set exist within our threshold of \\(c_i\\), the cone is chosen that will minimize the mean distance between cones from all images \\(N\\)

$$
\min \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N-1}\left\|c_{i}, c_{j}\right\|^{2}
$$

Finally, cone location similarity is reported as the percentage of the number of detected shared cones, \\(C_s\\), and the mean number of cones, detected across \\(N\\) imaging sessions, where \\(n_s\\) is the number of cones detected

$$
C L S=\frac{C_{s}}{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} n_{c}} \times 100
$$
