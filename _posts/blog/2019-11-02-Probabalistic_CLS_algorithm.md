# Cone Location Similarity Algorithm

Post image phase

## Processing Phases

1) Raw image and cone detection

We can see it is difficult to identify any photoreceptors and the standard local maxima detection returns nothing

2) Rolling ball back ground subtraction

We can see it is difficult to identify any photoreceptors and the standard local maxima detection returns nothing

3) Gaussian filter, background subtraction, and intensity based normalization

We can see it is difficult to identify any photoreceptors and the standard local maxima detection returns nothing
