Second year PhD student studying [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/) at Oregon Health & Science University. 

I am currently a student in Dr. Bonnie Nagel's [Developmental Brain Imaging Lab](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/psychiatry/research/developmental-brain-imaging-lab/index.cfm) where I am interested in using high dimensional behavioral and neuroimaging data to build models to predict future suicide risk in children and adolescents.  

Additionally, I worked as a developer and engineer in Dr. Nagel's lab to develop and maintain pipelines to process and interpret multi-modal neuroimaging data.  

My interests include
  - Image processing
  - Machine learning
  - Neuroimaging 
  - Prediction of suicide risk
  - Natural language processing
  - Deep learning
